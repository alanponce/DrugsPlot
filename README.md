# DrugsPlot

The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) elaborates every year a report with information about consume of drugs and the impact on society.

As we can read in EMCDDA website:

The EMCDDA was set up to provide 'factual, objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs, drug addiction and their consequences'
If we visit the category "data" into the website, we can see a large number of valuable information separate by sections, such as  Prevalence of use drug, Overdose deaths, Infection diseases, Price, Purity, Potency..Each section is subdivided into other sections, as we can see in the next image:

Besides, the information is divided by countries and genre:

We can obtain every set of data through a excel file (.xlsx)

Definitely, we have a great source of information obtained from European countries (+ Turkey) segmented by a broad and diverse number of variables.

But, there is a problem...

The website does not offer visualization tools which allow the user to understand that data of a fast and easy way.

DrugsPlot solves this problem. These are the characteristics which define the project:

An easy way of interaction between the user and web interface. 

### The user can modify every variable and the webtool reflect changes instantly.
### Clear way of interpretation through legends of color.
### Multiple type of graphics ( interactive boxplot, map, bar chats) which reflect the same data with different perspectives.

DrugsPlot has been developed with R language and the packages: ggplot2, dplyr, xlsx, maptools, Shiny and plotly among others.
